# Incentive-mechanism
These documents are all of the experimental data of our paper "Incentive Mechanism for the Listing Item Task in Crowdsourcing". 

These documents mainly contain four parts which are listed in the following:
  - TASKS: Listing item tasks and multiple choice tasks assigned in the experiments
  - ANSWERS: Collected original answers from workers
  - VIDEOS: Videos of our platform CrowdKnow 
  - LINKS: Links of tasks assigned to the open platform ZhiDao

## TASKS
All of the tasks have been translated to English. A file in two languages are distinguished by "(CN)" and "(EN)" in file name.

  - Listing Item Task(CN/EN).txt: 50 listing item tasks
  - Multiple Choice Tasks(CN/EN).txt: 50 multiple choice tasks

## ANSWERS
All of the collected answers have been translated to English. A file in two languages are distinguished by "(CN)" and "(EN)" in file name.
  - Answers from open platform(CN/EN).txt: The collected answers from open platform.
  - Answers from our platform(CN/EN).txt: The collected answers from our platform.

Each file contains the answers under six incentive mechanisms. Under each mechanism, a row of the data contains the answers submitted by a worker, the answers to each task are separated by commas.

## VIDEOS
Two videos are used to show how our crowdsourcing platform works. 
  - worker.mp4: This video shows the process of a worker logging on to the platform and completing the crowdsourcing tasks
  - requester.mp4: This video shows the process of a requester logging on to the platform and downloading the collected answers
